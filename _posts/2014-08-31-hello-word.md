<p>First time in Greece! Of seeing how this is a short trip, keep it to just Santorini and Athens. Being a big planner, of course each step of the trip was researched. </p>
<p>First stop Santorini! You actually can't reach the island direct direct international flight. Aegean Air is the only airline that'll get you there by flight</p>
